<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Trinity is a private, liberal arts and sciences institution and was founded in 1869. The student body consists of approximately 2,300 undergraduate and 200 graduate students.</p>

<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are how the class size is small so the teachers are able to get to know the students and work with them. They also focus a lot on the student’s success at the school along with their future. The school has some top quality athletics for a D3 school and take pride in their programs.</p></br>
<p>I chose Trinity University for many reasons. I wanted to stay in Texas and continue playing soccer. Along with the sports and the location, I knew the academics where top class and that I could push myself academically wise here.</p>

<p>I am thinking of majoring in Business Finance because it interests me the most. Also, I know people who have majored in the same thing and the jobs they have are interesting to me and could be something that I potentially do.
Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
